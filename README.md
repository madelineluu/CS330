# CS330 — C/C++ and Unix  
**University of Oregon**

This repository contains my homework assignments, labs, and optional exercises completed for **CS 330: C/C++ and Unix** at the University of Oregon (Spring 2025).

## Course Overview

CS 330 focuses on **practical software development** in **C and C++** within a **Unix/Linux environment**.  
The course emphasizes understanding how software interacts with the operating system, memory, and file systems, as well as effective use of programming tools and debugging techniques.

### Key Topics
- Software design and modular programming in C and C++  
- Use of Unix development tools: compilers, debuggers, and the shell  
- File I/O, pointers, and dynamic memory management  
- Process control, system calls, and signal handling  
- Makefiles and build automation  
- Command-line programs and scripting in Unix

Each homework, lab, or project folder usually includes source code files (`.c`, `.cpp`, `.h`), test cases, Makefiles or build scripts, and documentation or readme files.

## How to Build / Run

1. Navigate into a specific assignment or project directory.  
2. Use `make` (if a `Makefile` is provided) or compile manually with `gcc` / `g++`.  
   ```bash
   make
   ./executable_name
3. Some labs may require additional command-line arguments or input files — check each folder’s README or instructions.
