Please read the instructions carefully, and follow them to the letter!

If you do not, there will be problems with grading, and you will receive a 0 for the assignment (and the following assignments if the problem is not rectified).

Part 1 (Setting up Bitbucket and ix-dev)

1) Create an account on ix-dev if you don't already have one.

     a) Go to https://systems.cs.uoregon.edu/

     b) User account info -> Newuser

     c) Do this as soon as possible, as it make take a few hours (to days) to create a new account.




2) Create an account on Bitbucket (https://bitbucket.org).

     a) Your Workspace ID should be in the form of "<last name>_<first_name>" so that we can easily recognize you from the workspace ID.

        If the ID is already taken, add "_<some number>" to the end to make it unique. For example, Smith_John_11

        If you are already using Bitbucket and changing the ID will result in problems with your other projects, then leave it as it is.




3) Log into ix-dev and clone the instructor's homework repo (https://bitbucket.org/jeewhanchoi/uoregon-cs330-s25-assignments/)

    a) Here is a link on how to log onto Unix/Linux systems using ssh: https://phoenixnap.com/kb/ssh-to-connect-to-remote-server-linux-or-windows

    b) Here is a link on how to clone a repo: https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/clone-a-git-repository/

       Use the "clone over ssh" using the command line (after logging into ix-dev).

    c) You also need to create a SSH key on ix-dev to access Bitbucket repos from ix-dev. This is explained here: https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/set-up-personal-ssh-keys-on-linux/

       Skip to "Create an SSH key pair" section, as ix-dev already has SSH installed and running.

       You can also skip "Add your key to the SSH agent" step if it gives you an error (it might on ix-dev).




4) Create a repo on your Bitbucket account with the name "uoregon-cs330-s25" (without the quotation marks).

     a) Make sure it's private.

     b) Make sure it's using git.

    c) Add the instructor (jeec@uoregon.edu) and the TA (check for the TA's email on Canvas syllabus) to your repo and give them write access.

        To add a user, 

         i) In your repo page, click on "Invite" on the upper right corner

         ii) Click on the admin group (it should have a name that looks like "bitbucket-admins-<username>"

         iii) Click on "Users" on the upper left corner.

         iv) Click on "Invite Users" on the upper right corner, and invite the instructors using their email addresses.

         v) Click on Groups on the upper left corner, then on the group name "bitbucket-admins-<username>"

         vi) Click on "Add group members" and the instructors should appear. Add the instructors.




5) Clone your repo "uoregon-cs330-s25" (make sure it's in a different directory than the instructor's homework repo).




6) Copy the directory "homework01" from  the instructor's homework repo directory to your personal repo directory.




7) Implement the function 'find_file()' which recursively searches the provided directory and its subdirectories to locate any file that matches the provided file name. Make sure to read the provided code FIRST before beginning the assignment.




8) Test your code against the provided directory structure and answer files. Use the following command to compile the code:

   gcc -std=c11 -D_DEFAULT_SOURCE main.c

   For example, executing './a.out . b.out' should generate the same output as what is shown in the 'ans1' file (it may be in a slightly different order).

   Executing './a.out . a.out' should generate the same output as what is shown in the 'ans2' file (it may be in a slightly different order).

   Note that there is a "." in between "./a.out" and "b.out" (or "a.out" in the second example).

   Play around with different directory structures and file names to make sure your code works correctly - your assignment will be evaluated on a different input directory structure and file names.




9) Commit your code and push it to Bitbucket.




10) Make sure the change has been successfully pushed to Bitbucket by going to your repo on the Bitbucket website and reading your main.c file

 
Part 2 (Survey)

11) Goto to the Google Forms survey (https://forms.gle/41XqFtD1fRafbGJy7) and fill out the survey.

    a) It will be used to collect your names and Bitbucket Workspace ID
